# Automation of watch topics

## Context of the project

> Today is your first day in 2nd year at Youcode Safi, as part of active pedagogy, your trainer has asked you to choose a monitoring topic, the latter is presented each day and in turn in an individual way from Monday to Friday.

> A watch topic is the result of research and documentation made by a learner shared with his colleagues from the Full Stack Js group at Youcode Safi, each watch topic is characterized by theme and a date.

> To automate the choice and planning of watch topics, you have to create a web interface in Html/CSS/JavaScript so that the trainer can list all the learners in the group, then we draw lots to select one. only learner, the latter will be deleted from the initial list and save it in a file The second part of the application consists in making the schedule by adding the dates to each learner with his watch subject The final result is to obtain a file complete list of all learners and selected watch topics and changeover days
