# Automate SafiAir Flight System

## Context of the project

> As part of the automation of the reservation system, the company SafiAir wishes to create a web application that will allow the reservation of flights to its customers via a responsive site. We assume that the customer (code, surname, first name, email, telephone) accesses the reservation HMI. The customer enters the departure/arrival city, the departure/arrival time, the departure/arrival date, and the number of places. The system displays a list of flight proposals on the reservation menu, indicating the description of the flights. If one of the flights requires a stopover, in this case the stopover airport is also displayed. The customer chooses the flight that interests him, and he requests the reservation of it. The system checks the availability of the flight. If the flight is available, a message is displayed to the customer “the confirmation of the reservation will be completed with the payment”.
> The customer is then redirected to the payment page.
> The customer receives an email confirming his reservation with the details of the chosen flight.
> The System then saves the details of the reservation in a file (txt)
> An administrator from SafiAir is in charge of flight management (Crud)
> The customer can add extras to his flights (example: Insurance, Meals, Hotel...)
